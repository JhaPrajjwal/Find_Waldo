# Find_Waldo
I was recently seeing the episode 3 season 9 of Friends TV series. Ross helps a little girl in finding Waldo in a book. I thought lets see if my computer can do this. So i came up with this script. It uses opencv and template matching to find the figure in the image. But the template has to be provided to the script.

Requires  opencv2 and numpy
